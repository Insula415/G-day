1. Right click on "goodmorning", go to properties and edit the permissons to make the file executable / run as a program.

2. Go into the directory of the "goodmorning" file (eg /home/usr/Desktop/G'day/) and open the terminal here
   I'd put all the files on Desktop as you can only currently run this script in the directory it is located in. 

3. Now type $ sudo cp goodmorning /usr/bin/

4. Execute by typing goodmorning in the terminal (Note that you have to be in the directory of the files to execute)

"goodmorning" and "gm.py" are on my Desktop so i only have to go into the Desktop terminal to execute it. I will eventually make it
so it is executable in all directories but for now I'm too lazy to do that.

THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH A VPN
