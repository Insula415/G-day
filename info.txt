1. We need to make the python script executable. Type "chmod +x gm.py" in your terminal.

2. Next, type sudo cp gm.py /usr/bin/goodmorning. 
The last word is what you need to type in the terminal, example: sudo cp gm.py /usr/bin/hello - I would type "hello" to run it.

3. That's it. Now when you type "goodmorning" in any directory it should work!
